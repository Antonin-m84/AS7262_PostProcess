Specific case of the AS7262 sensor waiting for a signal to register. 
Only one color is recorded. Acquisition frequency defined by the arduino crystal, can be modified up to 300Hz.

Wiring :
SDA SCL 3.3v GND (Sensor adafruit),
D10 D11 (2 LEDs),
D2 external start signal (5v rising edge)

For 3D files, few areas may need to be sanded to ensure smooth running.
